lease make sure that you use the documents that match your Electron version.
The version number should be a part of the page URL. If it's not, you are
probably using the documentation of a development branch which may contain API
changes that are not compatible with your Electron version. To view older
versions of the documentation, you can
[browse by tag](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/v1.4.0)
on GitHub by opening the "Switch branches/tags" dropdown and selecting the tag
that matches your version.
